# Packing-Assistant

## Basic Idea - 

An AI app/website which let’s you know the weather, prices of the plane/train tickets, which places to visit in the country/city you are planning to visit, and will give you a full guide how, when, where at what time to visit each place.

1. place to go
2. how many days?
3. reason for visiting like different places will suggested to different users based on their reasons.
4. Starting & Ending date.
5. User’s budget

The above is what user should provide or the LLM will ask the user directly  

The LLM will respond with - 

* Weather for each day they are visiting (same as the above point)
* Suggest places to visit for each day
* What type of clothes to wear and how much to pack 
* Famous restaurants and hotels and Airbnb [budget accordingly]
* Different activities to do there based on user’s input
* Give opinion, if is it a good time to visit or not? #
* Give an estimate budget based on user’s input
* Suggest uber or car rentals
* Suggest shopping store
* Use Google Maps for increasing interactiveness with the user.
